Project number 2 is the same website, but with some major changes. ☘️

Instead of using static code as HTML and CSS. This is is made using Javascript, express.js and Node.js. 🚀
All the products are now generated dynamically from backend. instead of being hard-coded directly in the ejs-file.

Instead of using CSS, i decided to try using the TailwindCSS framework. Also added a better footer, credits to @flowbite for the component library 😎

Database created using bettersqlite3. Products on the administration page is fetched straight from the database using fetch-api 🎊
